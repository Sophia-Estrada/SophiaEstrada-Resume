        <p class="lead mb-4">As a young girl, I was taught to always hold myself up professionally when around adults. That meant no joking around, or moving, or anything fun. Now that I am one myself, I now realize that not everything has to be so uptight. I can be myself and still be professional. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll be goofy in the workspace, but that does mean I‚Äôll be a more relaxed worker. Relaxed. Never lazy. I find that to be a strength of mine. Even under pressure, I can handle it with ease. That was put to the test in my after school activity called Show Choir. There was always constant stress on whether or not I was singing the right note or dancing in sync with the others. It was even worse when I was put in with the middles, which were the smallest group of harmonizers besides the altos. So the pressure was on the few of us to make the harmonies sound perfect and full, otherwise the songs wouldn‚Äôt sound right. From that, I learned that sometimes, if you put too much pressure on yourself to succeed, you‚Äôll break yourself. The more stressed I was, the more strain it was on my voice, too. So I learned when to relax and when to be in serious mode. There‚Äôs a good balance that I found and this makes me think more clearly in any area. It was helpful in high school and is still helpful in college.<br><br>
        
        But I never really understood how to handle stress when I was stressed too well before I had my first job. Even though my first job wasn‚Äôt technically a job, meaning that I was just a volunteer, I tried to treat it as one. It was there that I learned how to handle my stress when I really didn‚Äôt have the time to really relax myself. One of these situations that I learned from was when I would be helping a pushy customer. I couldn‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù and leave or tell them off, I had to learn how to manage stress in the moment and let out my aggressions through physical activity afterwards. By keeping my emotions at bay but also having a healthy way of dealing with them is the key to success. I even spiced up whatever activity I used to relieve stress. I picked up boxing, running, and aerobics.<br><br>

        Then I had my last job. My mom started a new business with Floor Coverings International in our town of Santa Clarita. I knew how to handle stress and manage a professional air about myself, even though I was just working for my mom, but I ran into a new problem. This job was a lot less of a physical activity and took a more mental toll on me than I was used to. And this job taught me the basics of Excel and Microsoft Word. My mom told me that the skills I would learn in that job would help me be more applicable to more jobs in the future.<br><br>
